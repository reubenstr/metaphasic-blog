The reMEDer is a neat unitasker that has a practical use. And, I considered exploring refining the packaging and selling them as a product. But, I would imagine most people would prefer to use their smart phone. Despite this, I believe there is a niche market of non tech capable people that want to simplify their life and are confortable having a reMEDer device. Then I remember the Fidget Cube Kickstarter campaign were Fidget Cube clones hit the market before the campaign ended - it's too difficult to compete with offshore manufacturing without deep pockets and IP protections.
