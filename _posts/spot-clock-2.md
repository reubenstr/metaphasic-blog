Spot Clock 2 shows live Au, Ag, and Pt spot prices.

Large digits were custom designed to fit the size of the frame.

The element indicates illumunate when the spot price of their respective metal is displayed on the numberic display.

The controls section allows manual selection of the metal of choice (otherwise the metals automatically rotate), the on-off power, and the connection indicator shows the WiFi and API status.

The back reveals the magic. Underneath the wood plates are NeoPixel strips that fit into the numeric segments.

Unlike my most other dashboards, this one is power via 120AC and using a MeanWell AC to DC PSU. In retrospect, I could of used my standard 12vDC 1A PSU since the digit LEDs are only solid red, green, or blue and should draw under 5 watts.

I used a ESP8266 since I had a few around.

A flaw in this project is the poor contrast between the illuminated digits and the faceplate. This picture is a fair representation of this flaw.

Update:

I since reworked the entire faceplate for better contrast and turned the metal indicators into buttons. At some point I will take pictures and update this post.
